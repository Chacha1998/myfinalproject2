    <div class="clothes-question">
        <p>At many jobs, you have to dress up for 
            work. It is recommended to spend no 
            more than 5% of your income on clothes. 
            Let's assume the average person spends 2.5% 
            of their income on work clothes specifically. 
            If you have to dress up for going into the 
            office, how much do you spend on clothes 
            assuming you spend 2.5% of your income 
            (ex: 2.5% of a $50,000 salary will be .025 * 50,000 = $1250)?

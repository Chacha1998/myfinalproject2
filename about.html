            <h2>Hi! I'm Zac. I currently work from home and I am a big fan of it! I save a lot of time from commuting and get to enjoy more time with my 
                cats and my girlfriend (who also works from home)! You have likely seen lots of articles about how working from home saves money. 
                Youâ€™ve also likely seen many jobs asking for people to return to the office. If you spend more money going to the office, how much more
                would you need to make to break even compared to working from home? My goal is to give you that answer. If you want to give it a 
                try, click on the Home tab to get started!
